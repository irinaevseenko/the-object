                <span class="unwrap" href>I have noticed a massive amount of printing problems with this found old book. Odd images, strange typographic decisions and mistakes, poor quality of paper through which you can see several overlapped pages. But then all these indignations turned out to become the inspiration for the ideas on how to interpret this book. As a result, each page in my book is constructed imitating that disturbing transparency of the original. To add more visual connection from the very beginning I also did an additional plastic cover. When it is on the book, it almost duplicates the cover of the original. And taking it off visualize what has been excluded from the original book. </span>
