                <span class="unwrap" href>From the beginning of the 20th century, space became not an absolute anymore but generated by matter, without which it would not have existed. Similarly, art stopped being limited to the representation of concrete, observative phenomena; instead, it became a pure construction of the mind. However, is it possible to represent & visualize with the artistic means something that cannot be actually present â€“ the irrational & the imaginary? Many avant-garde artists of that time tried to incorporate these concepts into their works, but I have selected those who let one physically experience the unity of time, movement and space, rather than being just a symbolic visualisation of scientific theories.</span>
