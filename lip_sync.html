                <span class="unwrap" href>Not a whole video though, just a one-minute fragment of the chosen song. My decision was to work with ‘Vienna’ by Ultravox. I wanted to keep the original video layer as the main element, not as some kind of supporting background for the attention-seeking lyrics (like many videos of this genre look like). So, I used the slightly modified original video (by re-filming its projection on the wall, which was made to avoid applying some desired analogues effects digitally) and animated lyrics, typographically imitating some kind of old subtitles appearance. So, if you are interested in what ‘Oooooh, Vienna’ may look like, you are welcome to watch, listen and sing it <a href="https://youtu.be/e4t7KgOEwL8" target="_blank">here</a>. </span>
