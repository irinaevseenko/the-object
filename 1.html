They work with the influence of the media and technology on our everyday life and focus on processes rather than products. They use Conditional Design as a term that refers to their approach rather than the chosen media. Briefly, there are three main elements to work with: process, logic and input. The process is the product, and it produces formations rather than forms. Logic is the tool and it is used to design the conditions through which the process can take place. Applied rules are used as constraints, which sharpen the perspective on the process and stimulate play within the limitations. Finally, the input is the main material. It engages logic and activates and influences the process.</span> A monospaced version of an existing typeface by a Swiss type foundry.
